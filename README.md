# General information about this project of Databases:
This university project was created for the course of 'Databases' during the 6th semester at ΝΤUA and more specifically at the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. 

# Project description:
We were asked to make an application for a hypothetical hotel, called ASDF Palace. Τhe hotel provides services such as rooms, bars, restaurants etc. The COVID-19 pandemic has lead the management team to adopt safety health protocols in order to protects the hotel's customers and diminish the virus cases. For this reason, all the customers as soon as they arrive to the ASDF Palace are given a NFC-enabled bracelet which is uniquely associated with each customer. At the same time, all the services which the guests use, are tracked via the NFC-bracelet and the virus cases are tracked immidiately. Least but not least, each customer has its customer card as in any ordinary hotel.

# Technologies:
1. MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE for the creation of the database.

2. Apache Web Server 2.4 in order to connect the database with the frontend.

3. PHP 8.0 for the backend of the application.

4. Mockaroo for the automated generation of data (https://www.mockaroo.com/).
